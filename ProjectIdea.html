  <h3 class="PageTitle">Project Idea</h3>
  <p><b>Overview</b></p>
  <p>
    My IT dream is a non-profit, web-based learning support system. The learning system, which supports dyslectic students 
    and helps them with the most difficult aspects of their learning process – reading and spelling. 
I imagine my web-based learning system as a web portal, includes an information from different web sources and a variety of the IT 
    abilities, as such as an efficient graphical, audio and video storage, an advanced voice-text interpretation, 
    a text-voice interpretation, video and audio chats, advanced text edition options and a graphical data-text data integration.
The learning support web portal will provide user-friendly and informative environment for the dyslectic students and their parents. 
    The major focus of the learning support system will be on the advanced voice-text-image interpretation.

  <p><b>Motivation</b></p>
  <p>
  <I am personally familiar with Dyslexia, the reading disorder and I would like to express my appreciation to all smart 
     and progressive people, who invented and developed the IT. I hope they know that their innovations positively changed 
     lives of many people. I cannot even start describing, how difficult is to interpreter teacher’ hand writing, 
     during the exam for the dyslectic person, to read a book with no ability of text-voice interpretation or write 
     the entire essay without the spelling checker.
I am not aiming to make a profit, I would like to contribute my personal knowledge and energy in order to improve other people lives. 
     According to ADA the Australian Dyslexia Association, about 10% of the Australian population had been diagnosed 
     with Dyslexia and I would like to improve their lives by creating focused, friendly and non-profit web learning resource.
