  <p><b>Overview</b></p>
  <p>
    My IT dream is a non-profit, web-based learning support system. The learning system, which supports dyslectic students 
    and helps them with the most difficult aspects of their learning process â€“ reading and spelling. 
I imagine my web-based learning system as a web portal, includes an information from different web sources and a variety of the IT 
    abilities, as such as an efficient graphical, audio and video storage, an advanced voice-text interpretation, 
    a text-voice interpretation, video and audio chats, advanced text edition options and a graphical data-text data integration.
The learning support web portal will provide user-friendly and informative environment for the dyslectic students and their parents. 
    The major focus of the learning support system will be on the advanced voice-text-image interpretation.
