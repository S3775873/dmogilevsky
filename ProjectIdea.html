  <p><b>Overview</b></p>
  <p>
    My IT dream is a non-profit, web-based learning support system. The learning system, which supports dyslectic students 
    and helps them with the most difficult aspects of their learning process – reading and spelling. 
I imagine my web-based learning system as a web portal, includes an information from different web sources and a variety of the IT 
    abilities, as such as an efficient graphical, audio and video storage, an advanced voice-text interpretation, 
    a text-voice interpretation, video and audio chats, advanced text edition options and a graphical data-text data integration.
The learning support web portal will provide user-friendly and informative environment for the dyslectic students and their parents. 
    The major focus of the learning support system will be on the advanced voice-text-image interpretation.
   </p>

  <p><b>Motivation</b></p>
  <p>
  I am personally familiar with Dyslexia, the reading disorder and I would like to express my appreciation to all smart 
     and progressive people, who invented and developed the IT. I hope they know that their innovations positively changed 
     lives of many people. I cannot even start describing, how difficult is to interpreter teacher’ hand writing, 
     during the exam for the dyslectic person, to read a book with no ability of text-voice interpretation or write 
     the entire essay without the spelling checker.
I am not aiming to make a profit, I would like to contribute my personal knowledge and energy in order to improve other people lives. 
     According to ADA the Australian Dyslexia Association, about 10% of the Australian population had been diagnosed 
     with Dyslexia and I would like to improve their lives by creating focused, friendly and non-profit web learning resource.

  <p><b>Detailed description of the features of the product or service</b></p>
   <p>
     The primary goal of the web-based learning resource is to support and improve learning experience. 
Dyslexia is a learning disorder, frequently caused by the unusual brain hemisphere operating. Usually the left hemisphere of our brain controls languages, speech, reading and writing skills, when the right hemisphere of the brain controls the body position and the visual information. In another words, dyslectic person, during the reading, writing and new languages learning processes instead of the usual left hemisphere operating with the right hemisphere, which makes the learning process extremely difficult and uncomfortable. 
The usual spelling checkers add-ins propose a list of possible spelling variations, which improves the user’s ability to spell the words, however the dyslectic student won’t be benefited from the regular list of suggested forms of the spelling in any way.
The improvement of the learning experience will be done by transformation of the vocal or textual input into the list of the possible homonyms and linking the homonyms to the matching images.
As well as the graphical presentation of the words will improve the learning process of the dyslectic people, since their reading or writing skills fully based on the images’ memorization, even the words themselves won’t be separated to the letters and sounds but would be remembered and recognized as images.
One of the text editing attributes will be the ability to modify the spaces between the words and change the background colour. I know these functionalities exist in any respectful text editor, but they are not as friendly as it expected and do not come together with the features described above.
In addition, the web learning resource will offer the uploaded text’ articulation. The students will be able to upload the textual information and the uploaded text will be articulated for them.
Besides all the useful functionalities the web resource will include video and audio chats for social interaction.

   <p><b>Tools and Technologies</b></p>
   <p>
     I prefer to keep the project resources simple and cost effective, ideally free of charge, so for the software development I would use Java and HTML programming languages supposably in the Eclipse development environment , for the data storage I would use the SQL Server Database and GitHub for the project online storage, management, versioning, security and content presentation.
As well as the project requires images which should be created, uploaded and stored, which will involve digital graphic designer and digital graphic software such as Adobe Photoshop, however existing images online appropriate catalogue could be used to reduce the costs.
The words’ pronunciation necessitates, high quality of the voice recording abilities and extended hardware storage for the audio files. Human resource to operate with the voice recording software and hardware and the resource with appropriate diction will be involved, these could be replaced with the pre-built software, such as google translate’ verbal transcription or the online appropriate audio catalogue, which would be much more cost effective and hopefully will satisfy the project requirements.
The speech-text and the text-speech technologies such as iSpeech or Dragon Naturally Speaking will be the essential components of the project. 
Professional advice of a Speech Pathologist will be highly appreciated.
   </p>
  
  <p><b>Skills Required</b></p>
   <p>
     To initiate safety working environment for the project the GitHub knowledge and operating skills will be required.
From the perspective of the project design Java and HTML programming abilities will be involved, most likely the Java Platform JDK with the Eclipse IDE will be used. The HTML language programming could be performed in any text editor, such as Notepad. 
The T-SQL language are going to be used for the textual data electronic storage, data organization and transactions.
Hopefully at least during the prototype stage of the project, graphical, audio and video data would not be created or stored on the project electronic facilities and would be replaced by the graphical, audio and video catalogues’ online subscriptions, so at least for the initial stages of the project the catalogue subscriptions will reduce the costs and eliminate the need of expensive skilled resources involvement, such as voice recording specialists and graphical designers.
The most important feature of the project would be the ability to convert the human voice into a list of the possible homonyms, then the homonyms will be described by the appropriate images.  According to my planning and understanding the voice-text translation will be done by external software and will not require any sophisticated skills and the text-image connection could be performed by the database objects proper organization.

    <p><b>Outcome</b></p>
   <p>
     Whether the project is successful, and the web-based learning platform focused on dyslectic audience had built, 
     it will benefit all Australian and maybe even global society, since with the time the resource could be translated to many 
     different languages. The web-based learning resource will improve and support remotely the learning process of many underestimated,
     devastated and in most of the cases humiliated students, moreover as we all know the chain is no stronger than its weakest link, 
     as well as the society. The remote students, even from the most distanced places, from all financial backgrounds will be able 
     to improve the quality of their spelling and reading with internet connection, by reviewing the converted from the voice images, 
     of the potential suitable words. The visual presentation of the words will help the student to memorise the words’ spelling, 
     the text editing abilities of the resource will allow the students to change the background colour and what is more important 
     to modify the distances between the words and simplify the reading process. The proper words pronunciation will also help creating
     the strong connection between the image, the spelling and the pronunciation of the words.
