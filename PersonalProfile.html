  <p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
  <p>
    I fully agree with the test results, I an open-minded, positive and a generally well-organized person, very assertive in my decisions. 
    I respect other people's views, plan my work, and am confident in my decisions, which makes me a great team member. 
    As a tactile learner, my only way to remember or learn new information is to practise it myself. Personally, 
    I don’t believe people can gain new skills by only memorizing and understanding them. 
    In my opinion the understanding of new principals is 50 percent of knowledge and the other 50 percent is practice.
   </p>

  <p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
  <p>My planning skills will bring a great value to the team. I am observant, which means I base my decisions on facts. 
    I can realistically evaluate my personal and other team members’ work and focus an effort on the achievable goals. 
    From my personal professional experience, tactile learners are the best programmers, 
    because computer programming requires a hands-on approach. I can support the team from the perspective of technical programming 
    and reduce the pressure on that aspect.
  </p>

  <p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
   <p>As I mentioned, my strong side is planning, realistic time and effort evaluation and responsible work delivery, 
  I would form a group with one or two intuitive types of personalities, since intuitive people 
     are great in idea generation. An ideally formed team would include all types of learning abilities. 
     Modern informative sources are full of audio and video contents. I guess my type of learning would be the longest one, 
     but it will be compensated by my “hands-on” approach, planning skills, calm personality and good manners.
