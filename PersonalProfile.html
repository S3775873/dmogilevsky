  <p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
  <p>
    I fully agree with the test results, I an open-minded, positive and well-organized person, very assertive in my decisions. 
    I respect other people’ views, plan my work, and confident in my decisions, which makes me a great team member. 
    As a tactile learner, my only way to remember or learn new information is to practise it myself. Personally, 
    I don’t believe people can gain new skills by memorizing and understanding only. 
    On my opinion the understanding of the new principal is the 50 percent of knowing it, the other 50 percent is the practice.
   </p>

  <p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
  <p>My planning skills will bring a great value to the team. I am an observant, which means I base my decisions on facts. 
    I can realistically evaluate my personal and other team members’ work and focus an effort on the archivable goals. 
    From my personal professional experience, the tactile learners are the best programmers, 
    because computer programming requires hands-on approach. I can support the team from the perspective of the technical programming 
    and reduce the pressure on that aspect.
  </p>

  <p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
   <p>Since as I mentioned, my strong side is the planning, realistic time and effort evaluation and responsible work delivery, 
  I would form the group with one or two intuitive types of the personalities, since the intuitive people 
     are great in ideas’ generation. Ideally formed team would include all types of learning abilities. 
     Modern informative sources are full of audio and video contents. I guess my type of learning would be the longest one, 
     but it will be compensated by my “hands-on” approach, planning skills, calm personality and good manners.
