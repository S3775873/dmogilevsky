    <b>
    What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? 
      Outline your IT experience (if any).
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
  Since I remember myself, I am a reader, my favourite genre has always been a science fiction.
    I’ve amazed by the technological abilities, which could significantly improve people’s life 
    and destroy any living organism on our planet in the same time. 
    I think my love to the science fiction books initiated my interest in IT.
    I completed the Diploma in IT and since than build SQL databases and program in T-SQL and VBA. 
  </p>
  <p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></p>
  <p>I have chosen to study online via Open Universities Australia, 
    since I have a full-time job as an VBA specialist and raise a family of 3 teenagers. 
    The RMIT web site was the most conveniently structured 
    and informative and those 2 facts had affected my decision to learn in RMIT.
  </p>
  <p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p></b>
  <p>I keen to achieve Australian Bachelor of IT degree and an advanced knowledge in the IT Industry, 
    gain new web programming skills, extend my professional writing skills and enrich my professional vocabulary.
