  Since I remember myself, I am a reader, my favourite genre has always been a science fiction.
    I’ve amazed by the technological abilities, which could significantly improve people’s life 
    and destroy any living organism on our planet in the same time. 
    I think my love to the science fiction books initiated my interest in IT.
    I completed the Diploma in IT and since than build SQL databases and program in T-SQL and VBA.
